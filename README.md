# Nier Automata Rich Presence

This project was made by modifying the [Crymachina RPC](https://github.com/Crymachina-modding/crymachina_rpc) mod. Visit this page to know how it all works and maybe make your own RPC project!

Thanks to [Mashynn](https://github.com/KirigiriX) for helping me understand how Cmake works! :)
